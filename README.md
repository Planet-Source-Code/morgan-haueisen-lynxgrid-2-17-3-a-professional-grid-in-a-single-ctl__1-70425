### Description

No voting please. The original author (Richard Mewett) has abandoned this Grid and is now using another; but this grid is too good to let die. This is a Major update (the number of changes made in this version are significant), so please read the HistoryLog before using. The HistoryLog also contains a list of all public subs, functions, and properties.

Notes: Not all properties are illustrated in the demo.

Oblivious omissions: Cell merging (got to complicated); Datacontrol support (which you should avoid anyway).

(Update: Added RowUnselect)
